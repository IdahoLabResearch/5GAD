    "# Written by Cooper Coldwell, June 23 2022\n",
    "This code's purpose is to read in '.pcapng' files from 3 sources--Normal-1UE, Normal-2UE, and Attacks--and parse the data to use for machine learning model training.  \n",
    "## Dataset Explanation\n",
    "### Normal-1UE\n",
    "The Normal-1UE sets represent normal 5G network traffic data collected on a simulated 5G Core connected to another computer simulating a Radio-Area-Network connected to a single User Equipment (UE, basically a 5G-capable device like a cellphone). Within the Normal-1UE directory are log files--containing the terminal logs for each Network Function (NF, the components of the 5G network)--and '.pcapng' files containing the captured 5G network packets.  \n",
    "The network traffic consisted of YouTube streaming, HTTP requests to popular websites, and data transfers to and from  FTP and SAMBA servers.\n",
    "### Normal-2UE\n",
    "The Normal-2UE captured data is very similar to the Normal-1UE data except with two simulated UEs. The network traffic was of the same type but divided between the two UEs. The goal here was to introduce more 'network regulation'-type data that was very weakly represented in the 1UE. Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "> A physical 5G network: a user with a 5G cellphone is moving, so the connection strength between the user and cell tower A weakens while connection strength to tower B is increasing. The network would detect this and make decisions whether to end the user's session with A and begin another with B.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With two UEs, we hope to see more of these types of intra-network communication packets.\n",
    "### Attacks\n",
    "The Attacks captured data were captured by executing 5G-specific attacks against the 5G Core from the 5G Core, i.e. a Bad Actor has gained access to the Core and is mucking around. There is very little internet traffic in this set because the attacks were run while the simulated UEs were idle. There might be some incidental traffic, but not much.\n",
    "## Data Handling\n",
    "The data is saved across many files. For the normal data, we are pulling the data from the 'allcap\\*.pcapng' files, which contains the combined data from all the network interfaces we recorded on; the allcap files represent the sum total of all the traffic inside the 5G Core as well as the data between the RAN and Core.\n",
    "When examining the captured packets with Wireshark and Scapy, we discovered that the packet layers containing the attacks were labelled as 'Raw' by Scapy, so we decided to discard the other layers. To convert the packets to a format usable for training ML models, this notebook performs the following:\n",
    "1. Read in the files with Scapy\n",
    "2. Convert the raw bytes for each to a string\n",
    "3. Add each successive packet to an array containing the other packets of the same classification (Normal-1UE, Normal-2UE, Attack)\n",
    "4. Combine subsets of the processed sets together to create a set containing normal data of both varieties and another set that is 50% attack, 50% normal. The packets in the mixed normal-and-attacks set are labelled according to whether they are normal or attack.\n",
    "    - These labels are not important for our training, because we use unsupervised learning to train a variational autoencoder on the normal data, but the labelled data is useful for comparing how well the VAE can differentiate between attacks and normal traffic.\n",
    "5. Shuffle each set, then normalize the length of each string of bytes\n",
    "6. Convert the strings of bytes to an array of bytes\n",
    "7. Save the datasets"
